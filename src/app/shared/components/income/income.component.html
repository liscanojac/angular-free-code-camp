<!-- why using the income component? -->
<!-- because I edited the locales, to make the currency symbol go to the right -->
<!-- But making the locales non default ones that could mess with the dates and other formatting -->
<!-- so, to keep it atomic I decided to just make a component with localeData modified that only managed the salary -->
<p>{{ salary | currency: 'VES': 'Bs.' : '.2-2' }}</p>
